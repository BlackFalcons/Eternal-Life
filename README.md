# Eternal-Life
Eternal life is a project that was made during the struggle of a poor apprentice and friend of my. Having to access AD and find students manually everyday instead of having a PowerShell script made his job like a nightmare and it easily became boring.

By making this script and running through it with him to teach him the use of PowerShell and git was crucial to improve his motivation and skills as a PowerShell developer.

## About
The script is made to do easy repetetive tasks even easier by making the process much shorter for the administrator himself.
