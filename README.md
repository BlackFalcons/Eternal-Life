# Eternal-Life

Eternal life is a project that was made during the struggle of a poor apprentice and friend of my having to access AD and find students manually instead of having a PowerShell script doing the job much easier.

What does the script do? It is made to do easy repetetive tasks even easier by making the process much easier for the administrator himself.
